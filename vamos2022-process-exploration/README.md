## Abstract

Cyber-Physical Production Systems (CPPSs) manufacture highly-customizable products from a product family following a sequence of production steps. For a CPPS, basic planners design feasible production process sequences by arranging atomic production steps based on implicit domainknowledge. However, the manual design of production sequences is inefficient and hard to reproduce due to the largeconfiguration space. In this paper, we introduce theIterativeProcess Sequence Exploration (IPSE) approachthat (i) elicitsdomain knowledge in an industrial variability artifact, usingthe Product-Process-Resource Domain-Specific Language(PPR-DSL); (ii) reduces configuration space size regardingstructural product variability and behavioral process variability; and (iii) facilitates efficiently exploring the configurationspace in a process decision model. For production processsequence design, IPSE is a first approach to combine structural and behavioral variability models. We investigated thefeasibility of the IPSE in a study on a typical manufacturingwork line in automotive production. We compare the IPSEto a traditional process sequence planning approach. Ourstudy indicates IPSE to be more efficient than the traditionalmanual approach.
